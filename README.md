# Quicksort Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of both deterministic and randomized Quicksort algorithms. The project explores their performance and analyzes the impact of randomization.

## Files
- `quicksort.py`: Python implementation of the algorithms.
- `report.pdf`: Detailed report on implementation, performance, and theoretical analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone <repository-link>
    cd quicksort
    ```
2. Run the code:
    ```
    python quicksort.py
    ```
3. Test with sample inputs or customize the input arrays in the script.

## Summary
- Deterministic Quicksort uses the last element as a pivot.
- Randomized Quicksort selects the pivot randomly to avoid worst-case performance.
